# 🥞 Breakfast Roulette

A fun and interactive breakfast app built for the [Web Dev Challenge Hackathon S2.E9: Breakfast Apps](https://codetv.dev/blog/web-dev-challenge-hackathon-s2e9-breakfast-apps) by Hashbrown and CodeTV.

## 🎯 About the Project

Breakfast Roulette is an interactive web application that helps users discover new wacky breakfast combinations by spinning a roulette wheel filled with delicious breakfast foods. Users can spin the wheel to randomly select ingredients and create their own breakfast masterpiece!

### 🏆 Hackathon Context

This project was built for the **Web Dev Challenge Hackathon S2.E9: Breakfast Apps**, which challenged developers to create breakfast-related applications using [Hashbrown](https://hashbrown.dev) - a tool for creating generative UIs with custom components and LLM guardrails.

**Challenge Requirements:**

- Build a breakfast-related app
- Use Hashbrown as part of the build
- 4-hour development time limit
- Deploy to a public URL

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Roulette Wheel**: Spin to randomly select breakfast ingredients
- **Recipe Generation**: Create unique breakfast combinations
- **Hashbrown Integration**: Built with Hashbrown for generative UI capabilities

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
